// Include sections for upcoming tasks, overdue tasks, and completed tasks.

// Task Management:
// Users can add, edit, and delete tasks.

// Priority Levels:
// Define three priority levels for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
// Users can set and update the priority of each task.

// Search and Filter:
// Implement a search functionality to find tasks quickly.
// Allow users to filter tasks based on priority and completion status.


// Technical Requirements:

// Frontend:
// Use a lightweight frontend framework - Next js.
// Implement a simple and clean user interface.

// Local Storage:
// Store task data locally using browser storage (localStorage or sessionStorage)
